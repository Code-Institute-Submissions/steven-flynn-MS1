Steven Flynn Milestone Project 1
One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.
Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
My idea is a website with 3 pages (and room for future development) dedicated to teaching an individual some basics about the circus community, health benefits to doing circus, props, tricks, stores, the Irish circus scene and where to meet like minded people (at least before and hopefully after Covid times). 

For future development, I can add extra sections to include details about other festivals overseas including the worlds biggest juggling convention, the European Juggling Convention (EJC). Can also expand the props section to include more obscure and difficult props like gunslinging and Cyr Wheel as well as how to make your own. 
UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
    • As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

This website is aimed at students and possibly people at a “consumer” level. Not aimed towards businesses but rather the individual and broadening their knowledge of the vast world of circus without the need to learn from multiple sources and risking getting conflicting information. A one stop shop for learning the basics for juggling.

# introduction to circus
Circus is a skill sharing based community so at it’s heart it is very social and open to new and improving jugglers as well as talented performers looking to spread their unique skill to make it a little less unique. Activities include ball juggling, hula hooping, poi, diabolo, acrobatics, plate spinning, unicycling and balloon modelling, to name but a few. In truth, just about any skill or trick involving any prop can be considered a circus skill.
# physical and mental benefits to circus
## physical
* Hand-eye coordination
* Focus
* Concentration
* Depth Perception
* Muscle Memory
* Neuromuscular balance

## mental
* improve self esteem
* developing new skills and interests
* meet new people
* Great for physically active learners

# college societies and some other Irish groups that meet up
How many in the circus community begin their journey is via the circus society or club in their college or university. This provides a space to meet people with similar interests and varied skill levels, the society or club usually provides a handful of equipment which allows you to try out a variety of props to find out what suits you best and the committee and other members can go as a group to circus events outside of your college or university to meet even more people with the community such as to circus conventions
Here are a few handy social links to help you find your nearest circus meet-up. The groups are usually friendly and welcome to new people joining in, even if you do not attend the college they are affiliated with.

* Introduction
* Props and stores
* Events
Juggling props are normally separated into a few categories of skill. Props can belong to one or more of these categories. These being:
* Juggling skills
* Dance (or spinning) skills
* Manipulation Skills
* Balance skills
 
# Juggling balls
This is the most common circus prop and first skill many jugglers take up. Some call it a gateway prop which evidently leads to trying to master many, many more.
# Contact juggling
A wonderful mix of juggling and manipulation. Contact juggling takes a single, solid, juggling ball sized sphere and the user manoeuvrers it across their body while maintaining contact
# Juggling clubs
Also referred to as “clubs” or “Skittles”, these are a step above the balls mentioned above. Because the clubs spin, it adds an extra dimension of timing and hand eye coordination to catch the club in the right place at the right time. 
# Hula Hoop
Hooping can be classified as a dance or a manipulation skill. People normally start this skill with traditional waist hooping but as people master the skill, the performer can instead hoop on their arms, legs or even nose (yes, this is a thing) and even transition their performance to have multiple hoops spinning on body parts simultaneously. 
# Poi
Poi is one of the main dance related skills as it relies heavily on rhythm, ensuring you and the props spin in tandem being sure that neither you nor the poi collide mid-spin.
# Diabolo
Pretty much a larger version of the yo-yo, the diabolo consists of 2 sticks attached with a string and oversized yo-yo looking diabolo. The user has to ensure the diabolo is constantly spinning at high speeds on the string while manipulating it into the air and around their body.

# Conventions
The biggest events in a jugglers calender are the conventions. Each one has their unique traits like the organisers, workshops and performers so no 2 conventions will ever be the same. However, each convention usually have the same list of events throuoghout the convention. Each convention will usually have workshops which are voluntarily led by attendees throughout the convention, a Gala show which is a whole host of professional performances from international and local guests, a renegade show which is a circus open mic night and circus themed games. The typical schedule for a circus convention is it takes place over a weekend, Friday afternoon to Sunday afternoon. Friday is usually some workshops and anything else that the organisers wish to put on like a secondary, show, a fire show or a little parade through the town square, to name but a few past ideas. Saturday usually has a lot more workshops from morning to early evening. Then attendees make their way to the location of the Gala show. After that, there is a short break and then the open mic night takes up the remainder of the night. Sunday has workshops going on from morning until early afternoon. After which the circus games commence and allow the community to engage their competitive side with a range of games, some requiring extreme technical skills and others just pure luck. Common games are 3 club gladiators, hula hoop racing and handstand endurance. 
# Freshers Fest
Initially set up by a UCD juggler by the name of Des Johnson in 2016, this convention focuses on new jugglers in Dublin and gives them a space to see first hand what their local jugglers can do and are encouraged that practise. The theme for the main Gala show is all the performers have never done a formal performance with their chosen prop, therefore enhancing the mantra that everyone at this, and every convention, are all newbies and constantly learning.
There is no official page for this convention but it is run by the UCD circus and juggling society fo check out their facebook page for updates on this convention [link] (https://www.facebook.com/UCDJugglingandCircusSociety)
# National Circus Festival of Ireland (NCFI)
The NCFI takes place every year in the town of Tralee, Co.Kerry since 2001. This festival is possibly the biggest circus event on the Irish calendar, pulling talent from all corners of the globe into a tightly packed schedule. Recently, this festival has added an extra day of activity and normally runs from Thursday – Sunday every year. The Sunday evening parade and street shows in the town square have been entertaining kids and adults alike since it’s inception. For more information, visit their website with photos, videos, past and future performers. [link] (http://www.circusfestival.ie/)
# Belfast Juggling Convention
Previously hosted by the Queens Circus Society, this convention is also usually very popular with jugglers from the Republic of Ireland as it is just a short drive away. It allows attendees to witness performances by jugglers from the UK juggling scene and a handful of other international performers too who each have their own unique style. What the Belfast Juggling Convention does differently is on the Friday night, they host an “open stage” show which creates a space for performers to showcase a routine they are working on for a smaller audience than if they were to try and run at on a bigger stage, allowing them to get feedback from the audience and fine tune their routine. For more information, follow Queens Circus Society on facebook [facebook page] (https://www.facebook.com/qubjuggling/)
# Dublin Circus Festival
The Dublin Circus Festival (previously named Dublin Juggling Festival) is a collaborative effort between the Dublin Circus Project and college circus societies. It is a way to bring Irish jugglers together and give everybody an excuse to play around with circus props around the capital. It’s Dublin’s way of giving back to the other circus groups who hold large conventions in other areas of Ireland, such as NCFI and the Belfast Juggling Convention. Follow their facebook page for updates [facebook page] (https://www.facebook.com/DublinCircusFestival/?ref=page_internal)
# Galway Juggling Convention
Our final stop on our circus journey around the island of Ireland is in the west coast in the beautiful city of Galway. Hosted by the National University of Ireland, Galway (NUIG) circus society, this convention is normally a sunny escape taking place during the summer, in May or June. The Galway Juggling Convention has all the same thrills and frills as the other conventions with added fun and chill out time. Who doesn’t love a sunny escape to Galway?

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
    • JQuery
        ◦ The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
    1. Contact form:
        i. Go to the "Contact Us" page
        ii. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
        iii. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
        iv. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

The first bug or problem I encountered was during the initial set-up. Because I had not used the code institute template to start, I could not view a preview of my work in a new tab or window, which was especially bad because I wanted to test my webpages responsiveness to different screen sizes (desktop vs mobile).  As time was of the essence, the fastest and easiest solution was to create a new repository using the code-institute template. Once I set that up properly, the preview page seemed to work as normally after copying and pasting the work I had already completed.
Another bug I encountered was with using and modifying the bootstrap styling on the images on the intro page to adjust their size and to make the images not appear when below a certain screen size. I tried to get this to work by creating my own styling classes for the individual images which did not seem to affect the sizes. So I decided to go back to basics and review the notes for the “love running” mini project. I went with a masonry design for the section that the photos where going to be which allowed the look clearer by taking up more of the column width. Also by following the lessons from the “love running” project, I created a media query to 

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
    • Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
    • Different configuration files?
    • Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
